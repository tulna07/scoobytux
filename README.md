### Hi there 👋

My name's Tu (aka Liam).

My major is Computer Engineering which primarily focuses on electrical/electronics‑related courses. However, I have switched my career
path to Web Development where I found building beautiful, useful and scalable web applications that resolve customers’ problems very
interesting.

Currently, trying to make TypeScript happy 😞
